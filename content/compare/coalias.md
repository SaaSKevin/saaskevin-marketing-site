## TL;DR

CoAlias is designed for no-code platforms (Bubble, Adalo, Webflow, etc.) with per-domain SEO customization and request-based pricing. SaaSKevin is designed for developers building custom SaaS with a simple widget integration and per-domain pricing. If you're building on a no-code platform, CoAlias may fit better. If you're writing code, SaaSKevin is simpler and cheaper.

## Different Target Audiences

This is the core distinction. CoAlias was built for **no-code app builders**—people using Bubble, Adalo, Airtable, FlutterFlow, Glide, Softr, and Webflow. It auto-detects your no-code platform and configures accordingly. If you're building a SaaS on one of these platforms, CoAlias understands your setup.

SaaSKevin was built for **developers** building custom SaaS applications with code. The widget embeds in any web application, the backend integration is 3 lines reading an HTTP header, and it works with any tech stack and hosting provider. If you're writing React, Next.js, Rails, Laravel, Django, or any other framework, SaaSKevin speaks your language.

## Pricing Comparison

CoAlias uses **tier-based pricing** with request limits. SaaSKevin uses **per-domain pricing** with no request limits.

**CoAlias tiers:**
- Trial: Free — 10 domains, 4,000 requests/month (CoAlias branded)
- Dev: $25/month — Unlimited domains, 40,000 requests/month
- Basic: $50/month — Unlimited domains, 400,000 requests/month
- Growth: $100/month — Unlimited domains, 2,000,000 requests/month
- Dedicated: $200+/month — Custom

**SaaSKevin:**
- Free: 3 domains, no request limits
- After free tier: $0.15/domain/month, no request limits

The CoAlias model means your costs are driven by traffic, not domains. If you have a few high-traffic domains, CoAlias could be cheaper. If you have many domains with moderate traffic, SaaSKevin is cheaper and more predictable.

**Example: 200 domains, moderate traffic (300,000 requests/month)**
- **SaaSKevin**: 3 free + 197 x $0.15 = $29.55/month
- **CoAlias**: Basic tier = $50/month (400,000 request limit)

**Example: 50 domains, high traffic (1,500,000 requests/month)**
- **SaaSKevin**: 3 free + 47 x $0.15 = $7.05/month
- **CoAlias**: Growth tier = $100/month (2,000,000 request limit)

CoAlias also **auto-upgrades your plan** if you exceed request limits. This means unexpected traffic spikes can increase your bill without warning.

## Request Limits vs No Limits

CoAlias caps monthly requests: 4,000 on the free tier, up to 2,000,000 on Growth. Exceed the limit and you're auto-upgraded to the next tier.

SaaSKevin has no request-based pricing or limits. You pay per domain, and traffic is included. For SaaS applications where individual customer domains might receive unpredictable traffic, this removes a variable from your cost model.

## Per-Domain SEO Customization

CoAlias has a unique feature: you can customize **favicon, Open Graph tags, social preview images, and meta tags** per domain from their dashboard. This is valuable for platforms where each tenant's domain needs distinct branding in search results and social shares.

SaaSKevin handles this differently—your application controls the HTML output for each custom domain, so you have full programmatic control over SEO tags. You write the code once, and it dynamically serves the right meta tags per customer. This is more flexible but requires your application to handle it.

## Wildcard Domains

CoAlias limits wildcard domains by plan: 0 on the free tier, 1 on Dev, 2 on Basic, 4 on Growth. SaaSKevin supports unlimited wildcard domains on all plans.

## Who SaaSKevin Is Best For

- Developers building SaaS with code (any framework, any hosting)
- Teams that want per-domain pricing with no request limits
- Startups that benefit from 3 free domains
- Products that need unlimited wildcard domains
- Teams that want an embeddable customer-facing widget

## Who CoAlias Is Best For

- No-code builders on Bubble, Adalo, Webflow, FlutterFlow, Glide, or Softr
- Platforms that need per-domain SEO customization from a dashboard (not code)
- Low-traffic applications where request-based pricing works out cheaper
- Teams that don't write backend code

If you're a developer building a SaaS with code, SaaSKevin's widget integration takes 5 minutes and costs nothing to start.
