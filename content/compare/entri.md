## TL;DR

Entri is a multi-product domain platform (Connect, Secure, Power, Sell) that excels at DNS auto-configuration—automatically detecting and configuring DNS for 75% of domains. SaaSKevin is a single focused product with a pre-built widget that handles everything in one integration. Entri starts at $249/month with 50 domain connections. SaaSKevin starts free with 3 domains.

## At a Glance

| Feature | SaaSKevin | Entri |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup time** | ~5 minutes | Days to a week (multiple products) |
| **Code required** | Read 1 HTTP header (3 lines) | Multiple product integrations |
| **Built-in user UI** | Pre-built embeddable widget | Entri Connect modal (DNS auto-setup) |
| **SSL certificates** | Automatic | Entri Secure (separate product, Let's Encrypt) |
| **DNS setup help** | One-click DNS + guided UI | Auto-detection for 75+ providers (75% zero-touch) |
| **Free tier** | 3 domains free | None |
| **Starting price** | $0/month | $249/month (50 domain connections) |
| **Hosting requirement** | Any hosting provider | Any hosting provider |
| **Products needed** | 1 (SaaSKevin) | Up to 4 (Connect + Secure + Power + Sell) |
| **Compliance** | Standard | SOC2, GDPR |

## Product Complexity

This is the biggest difference. Entri is a **suite of four products**, each solving a piece of the custom domain puzzle:

- **Entri Connect**: Automates DNS record setup by detecting the user's DNS provider and auto-configuring records
- **Entri Secure**: SSL certificate provisioning and management
- **Entri Power**: Reverse proxy infrastructure for routing custom domain traffic
- **Entri Sell**: Sell domains directly within your SaaS application

To get a complete custom domain solution comparable to SaaSKevin, you likely need **Connect + Secure + Power**—three separate products, three integrations, potentially three subscriptions.

**SaaSKevin** is one product that handles everything: DNS setup guidance, SSL provisioning, reverse proxy routing, and customer-facing domain management. One integration, one subscription, one dashboard.

## DNS Auto-Configuration

Entri's standout feature is **Entri Connect**. It detects which DNS provider a customer uses (supporting 75+ providers), authenticates with that provider, and auto-configures the required DNS records. 75% of domains are configured automatically with zero user effort. This is genuinely impressive and unique in the market.

SaaSKevin uses **guided DNS setup** with visual instructions in the widget, and supports **Domain Connect** for one-click setup on supported registrars. Users still need to interact with the setup flow, but the widget makes it straightforward with step-by-step guidance.

If reducing DNS-related support tickets to near-zero is your top priority and you serve non-technical users, Entri Connect's auto-configuration is a strong differentiator. If your users are developers or technical enough to follow DNS instructions, SaaSKevin's guided approach works well.

## Pricing Comparison

The pricing gap is substantial, especially at early stages.

**SaaSKevin:**
- 3 domains free (forever)
- $0.15/domain/month after that
- No minimum spend

**Entri:**
- Startup plan: $249/month for 50 domain connections
- Higher tiers: Contact sales (pricing not public)
- Each product (Connect, Secure, Power) may be priced separately

**Example: 50 domains (early-stage)**
- **SaaSKevin**: 3 free + 47 x $0.15 = $7.05/month
- **Entri**: $249/month (Startup plan)

**Example: 500 domains**
- **SaaSKevin**: 3 free + 497 x $0.15 = $74.55/month
- **Entri**: Custom pricing (contact sales)

For startups and early-stage products, SaaSKevin's free tier and $0.15/domain pricing means you can validate the custom domain feature without spending $249/month before you know if customers want it.

## Enterprise Features

Entri targets enterprise customers and offers **SOC2 and GDPR compliance**, which matters for companies with strict security and privacy requirements. They count S&P 500 companies as customers and have a GoDaddy partnership for Domain Connect.

SaaSKevin targets startups and growing SaaS platforms. The focus is on simplicity and speed rather than enterprise compliance certifications.

If your company requires SOC2-compliant vendors, Entri's compliance posture is a differentiator.

## Domain Selling

Entri offers a unique feature: **Entri Sell** lets you sell domains directly within your SaaS application. Customers can search and purchase domains from hundreds of TLDs, with DNS automatically configured after purchase.

SaaSKevin does not offer domain selling. It focuses on managing custom domains that customers already own.

## Who SaaSKevin Is Best For

- Startups and growing SaaS platforms that want to start free
- Teams that prefer a single, focused product over a multi-product suite
- Developers who want a 5-minute integration, not a week-long implementation
- Cost-conscious teams where $0.15/domain matters vs $249/month minimum
- Products where users are technical enough to follow guided DNS setup

## Who Entri Is Best For

- Enterprise SaaS companies that need SOC2/GDPR-compliant vendors
- Platforms serving non-technical users where DNS auto-configuration eliminates support tickets
- Companies that want to sell domains to their users (Entri Sell)
- Large-scale operations where the $249/month minimum is a rounding error
- Teams willing to integrate multiple products for best-in-class DNS automation
