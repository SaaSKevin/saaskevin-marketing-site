# Custom Domains for Link-in-Bio Tools

Your creators want to share **theircreatorname.com**, not **yourplatform.com/theircreatorname**.

Custom domains transform your link-in-bio platform from a tool into a brand. When creators can use their own domain, you become the infrastructure powering their personal brand—not just another SaaS they're renting from.

## The Problem

Every creator platform faces the same request: "Can I use my own domain?" Without custom domain support, you're telling your most ambitious users that your platform isn't ready for their professional needs.

Link-in-bio tools without custom domains feel temporary. Creators hesitate to build their entire online presence on **yourapp.com/username** because they know they don't own that URL. One policy change, one price increase, and their audience loses access to their link hub.

## The Solution

SaaSKevin makes custom domains trivial to add. Your creators get:
- **Professional branding** - **creator.com** instead of **yourapp.com/creator**
- **Platform independence** - They own the domain, not you
- **Automatic SSL** - HTTPS works instantly, no certificates to manage
- **Simple setup** - Your users connect their domain in minutes, not hours

## Why Link-in-Bio Tools Need Custom Domains

**Premium Feature Differentiation**: Custom domains are a clear upgrade path. Free users get **yourapp.com/username**, paid users bring their own domain.

**Higher Customer Lifetime Value**: Creators who invest in a custom domain stick around 3-5x longer. They've integrated your platform into their brand identity.

**Competitive Advantage**: Linktree doesn't make custom domains easy. Beacons charges extra. You can offer it seamlessly and win premium creators.

**Professional Positioning**: When influencers, consultants, and small businesses evaluate your platform, custom domain support is table stakes.

## How It Works for Your Platform

1. **Add our widget** to your settings page (one line of code)
2. **User enters their domain** - We guide them through DNS setup
3. **Automatic verification** - We check DNS and provision SSL
4. **Read one header** - Your backend reads `X-SaaSKevin-Customer-Id` to identify which creator to display

Your backend code doesn't change. You're already serving content at **yourapp.com/creator**—now you also serve it at **creator.com**.

## Common Use Cases

- **Instagram influencers** - Professional link hub at their personal domain
- **YouTubers** - Channel domain pointing to all their content links
- **Small businesses** - Company domain for their link collection
- **Consultants** - Professional domain for booking, portfolio, and socials
- **Podcasters** - Show domain with links to all platforms

## Pricing

Start with **100 free custom domains**. After that, **$0.09 per domain per month**. No setup fees, no hidden costs. If a creator removes their domain, you stop paying.
