# Custom Domains for Class & Workshop Booking

Yoga studios, fitness instructors, and workshop facilitators want students booking at **studio.com**, not **yourplatform.com/studio**.

Mindbody and similar platforms force their branding on every studio. Students see **mindbody.com** in the URL when they book. Studios hate this—they're paying for software but advertising someone else's brand.

## The Problem

When a yoga studio sends students to book a class, they want that transaction happening at **yogastudio.com/schedule**, not **yourplatform.com/yogastudio**. The URL matters because students assume the studio owns the technology they're using.

Small studios and independent instructors especially care about branding. They're competing with big chains and need every trust signal they can get. A custom domain makes them look more established.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Give studios and instructors the branded booking experience they need:

- **Class schedule at their domain** - **studio.com/classes** instead of platform branding
- **Booking flow integration** - Students never leave the studio's brand
- **Automated confirmations** - From studio's domain, not yours
- **Professional appearance** - Custom domain builds trust and credibility

## Why Class Booking Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Beat Mindbody**: Studios complain about Mindbody's branding and pricing. Offer custom domains at a lower price point and win independent studios.

**Studio Branding Control**: Studios invest in their brand. They don't want platform URLs confusing their students about who they're booking with.

**Multi-Location Studios**: Studio chains need custom domains for each location or a unified domain with location pages. This locks them into your platform.

**Workshop Facilitators**: Independent instructors running workshops need professional booking pages. Custom domains make them look established.

## How It Works

Studios connect their domain or subdomain to your platform. SaaSKevin handles DNS and SSL verification automatically. Your platform reads the incoming domain to display the correct schedule and availability.

Students browse classes, book spots, and receive confirmations—all branded as coming from the studio, not your platform.

## Common Use Cases

- **Yoga studios** - Class schedules and booking at studio domain
- **Fitness studios** - CrossFit, Pilates, barre studios with custom domains
- **Dance schools** - Class registration at school domain
- **Art workshops** - Creative workshops with professional booking
- **Cooking classes** - Culinary schools and cooking classes with branded booking

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. Then **$0.09/domain/month**. Studios typically pay $50-150/month for booking software—custom domains justify premium pricing.

## Get Started
