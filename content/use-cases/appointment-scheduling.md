# Custom Domains for Appointment Scheduling

Consultants want clients booking at **book.consultant.com**, not **yourscheduler.com/consultant**.

Cal.com proved that developers want self-hosted scheduling. But most professionals don't want to self-host—they want the ease of SaaS with the branding of custom domains. Give them both.

## The Problem

Calendly dominates scheduling, but their free tier forces **calendly.com/username** branding. Professionals hate this. When they send **calendly.com/consultant** to a client, they're advertising Calendly, not their services.

Cal.com offers self-hosting for custom domains, but that requires technical expertise most consultants don't have. They want the simplicity of hosted software with the professionalism of their own domain.

## The Solution

SaaSKevin lets you offer custom domain scheduling without self-hosting complexity:

- **Professional booking pages** - **consultant.com/book** instead of **yourapp.com/consultant**
- **Email calendar invites** - From their domain, not yours
- **Client trust** - Custom domain + SSL = legitimate business
- **Zero maintenance** - We handle DNS, SSL, and renewal automatically

## Why Scheduling Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Beat Calendly**: Their free tier doesn't allow custom domains. If you offer custom domains at a lower price point, you win consultants, coaches, and freelancers.

**Enterprise Clients**: Companies want their scheduling at **company.com/schedule**, not **yourplatform.com/company**. Custom domains unlock B2B sales.

**Professional Services**: Lawyers, accountants, therapists, and consultants all need professional scheduling. Custom domains are table stakes.

**Premium Feature**: Custom domain support is an obvious upsell. Charge $10-15/month extra and users happily pay.

## How It Works for Your Platform

Users connect a domain or subdomain (like **book.consultant.com**). We guide them through DNS setup with visual instructions. Your platform reads `X-SaaSKevin-Customer-Id` to identify which calendar to display.

Booking confirmations can be sent from their domain, calendar invites can reference their domain—everything feels like it's their tool, not yours.

## Common Use Cases

- **Consultants** - Client booking at professional domain
- **Coaches** - Session scheduling at personal brand domain
- **Therapists** - HIPAA-compliant booking at practice domain
- **Sales teams** - Demo scheduling at company domain
- **Agencies** - Client meeting scheduling at agency domain

## Pricing

First **100 domains free**. Then **$0.09 per domain per month**. Most scheduling platforms charge $10-15/month for custom domain access, making this a highly profitable feature.

## Get Started

Give professionals the scheduling experience they need. Custom domains make your platform invisible infrastructure—users present their brand, you handle the technology.
