# Custom Domains for Digital Product Sales

Creators selling digital products want **products.creator.com**, not **yourplatform.com/creator**.

Gumroad forces creators onto **gumroad.com/creator** URLs. Creators hate this because they're building a business, not promoting Gumroad. Custom domains let creators own their distribution channel.

## The Problem

When a creator sells a $50 ebook or a $200 course, that transaction should happen at their brand, not yours. Every time a customer sees **yourplatform.com** in the checkout URL, the creator loses brand equity.

Creators with multiple products especially need custom domains. If they're selling templates, ebooks, courses, and tools, they want all products under one domain they control—**creator.com/products**.

## The Solution

SaaSKevin makes custom domain digital product sales simple:

- **Branded product pages** - **creator.com/product-name** instead of platform URLs
- **Custom checkout** - Payment at creator's domain, not yours
- **Download links** - From creator's domain for brand consistency
- **Email delivery** - Product delivery emails from creator's domain

## Why Digital Product Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Creator Independence**: Creators want to feel like they own their business. Custom domains give them that ownership while you power the infrastructure.

**Higher Perceived Value**: A $500 course sold at **expertname.com/course** feels more valuable than **platform.com/expert/course**. Custom domains justify premium pricing.

**Email Deliverability**: When creators send product updates and marketing emails from their custom domain, spam filters trust them more.

**Competitive Advantage**: Gumroad makes custom domains difficult. If you make them easy, you win creators who care about their brand.

## How It Works

Creators connect their domain or subdomain. Your platform handles product display, payments, file delivery, and customer management—all at the creator's domain.

When customers download products, the URLs reference the creator's domain. Email receipts come from the creator's domain (with proper email authentication). Everything feels like the creator's independent business.

## Common Scenarios

- **Course creators** - Online courses at custom domains
- **Template sellers** - Design, Notion, spreadsheet templates
- **eBook authors** - Self-published books with branded sales pages
- **Software tools** - Indie developers selling digital tools
- **Asset creators** - Stock photos, music, fonts at custom domains

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. After that, **$0.09/domain/month**. Digital product platforms typically charge creators $10-20/month for custom domain support.

## Get Started

Help creators build real businesses with branded digital product stores. Custom domains make your platform invisible infrastructure.
