# Custom Domains for Video Hosting Platforms

Video creators want viewers watching at **creator.com**, not **yourplatform.com/creator**.

Vimeo offers custom domains for professional accounts because businesses using video for courses, demos, or marketing need branded hosting. If your platform doesn't support custom domains, you can't compete for professional users.

## The Problem

When businesses embed video players on their website, they don't want **yourplatform.com** branding appearing. When creators share video links, they want **creator.com/video-name**, not **platform.com/user/video**.

Professional video creators—course creators, agencies, and brands—need video hosting that reflects their brand, not yours.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Make video hosting feel like custom infrastructure:

- **Videos at custom domain** - **creator.com/videos** instead of platform branding
- **Embedded players** - Video players that match creator's domain
- **Direct video links** - Shareable URLs at creator's domain
- **Thumbnail images** - Video previews served from creator's domain

## Why Video Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Course Creators**: Online courses embed dozens of videos. Custom domain players look professional; platform-branded players look cheap.

**Marketing Teams**: Companies hosting product demos and explainer videos need custom domains for brand consistency.

**Agencies**: Video production agencies hosting client content need white-label solutions with custom domains per client.

**Premium Pricing**: Custom domain support justifies charging $50-200/month vs. $10/month for basic hosting.

## How It Works

Creators connect their domain to your platform. Videos, playlists, and channel pages all load at **creator.com**.

Embedded video players reference the custom domain. Direct video links use the custom domain. To viewers, it looks like a custom-built video site.

## Common Scenarios

- **Online courses** - Course videos at course creator's domain
- **Product demos** - SaaS companies hosting demos at company domain
- **Agency portfolios** - Video production work at agency domain
- **Creator channels** - Video creators with branded video sites
- **Corporate training** - Internal training videos at company domain

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. Then **$0.09/domain/month**. Video platforms charge $30-100/month for custom domain support.

## Get Started

Give video creators the professional hosting they need with custom domain video platforms. Make your infrastructure invisible.
