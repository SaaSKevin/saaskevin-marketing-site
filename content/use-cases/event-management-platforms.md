# Custom Domains for Event Management Platforms

Event organizers want **event.com**, not **yourplatform.com/event123**.

When an organizer promotes a conference, workshop, or meetup, the URL matters. **yourplatform.com/event** looks temporary. **event.com** looks professional. Custom domains are the difference between a hobby project and a real event.

## The Problem

Eventbrite and similar platforms force their branding on every event. Attendees register at **eventbrite.com/e/event-name**, not the organizer's domain. This works fine for small events, but professional organizers hate it.

Corporate events, conferences, and professional workshops need to maintain brand consistency. When an attendee visits **company-conference.com**, they should see the company's brand—not your platform's.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Let organizers run events at their own domain without complex infrastructure:

- **Branded event pages** - **event.com** instead of **yourplatform.com/event**
- **Custom registration** - Attendees register at organizer's domain
- **Email consistency** - Confirmations from event's domain, not platform's
- **Professional appearance** - Custom domain signals legitimacy

## Why Event Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Enterprise Sales**: Corporate events and conferences require custom domains. Without them, you can't sell to businesses running professional events.

**Higher Ticket Prices**: Events with custom domains can charge more. A $500 conference at **conference.com** feels more valuable than the same event at **yourplatform.com/conf2026**.

**Recurring Events**: Once an organizer sets up a custom domain for their annual conference, they're locked into your platform. Switching means losing their event URL.

**White-Label Opportunities**: Event management companies running multiple clients' events need custom domains for each. One company might manage 10-20 events per year.

## How It Works

Event organizers connect a domain (or subdomain) to their event. SaaSKevin handles DNS verification, SSL provisioning, and routing. Your platform reads which event to display from the incoming domain.

Registration forms, ticket purchases, and email confirmations all reference the custom domain. To attendees, it looks like a standalone event website.

## Common Scenarios

- **Conferences** - Annual tech conferences at dedicated domains
- **Corporate events** - Company offsites and internal events
- **Workshops** - Educational workshops at brand domains
- **Meetups** - Local community events with professional domains
- **Virtual events** - Webinars and online conferences with custom branding

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. After that, **$0.09/domain/month**. For event platforms, you can charge organizers $20-50/event for custom domain access—a significant revenue opportunity.

## Get Started

Help event organizers present professional, branded experiences. Custom domains make every event look like a standalone production.
