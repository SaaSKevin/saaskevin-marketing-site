# Custom Domains for Documentation Sites

Software companies want docs at **docs.company.com**, not **yourplatform.com/company**.

GitBook, ReadTheDocs, and Notion all support custom domains because professional documentation needs to live at the company's domain. Without custom domain support, you can't sell to B2B software companies.

## The Problem

When developers search for API documentation, they expect **docs.company.com**, not **randomdocsplatform.com/company**. Custom domain documentation builds trust and looks professional.

Software companies with enterprise customers especially need custom domains. When an enterprise client evaluates your API, documentation at your company domain signals reliability.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Make documentation feel like native infrastructure:

- **Docs at company domain** - **docs.company.com** instead of platform branding
- **API reference pages** - Technical docs at company's domain
- **Search engine indexing** - Documentation ranks under company domain
- **SSL certificates** - Secure documentation automatically

## Why Documentation Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Developer Trust**: Developers trust **docs.stripe.com** more than **docsplatform.com/stripe**. Custom domains build credibility.

**Enterprise Sales**: Enterprise software companies won't host docs on someone else's domain. Custom domains are required for B2B sales.

**SEO Benefits**: When developers search for solutions, companies want results pointing to their domain, not yours.

**Brand Consistency**: API docs, product docs, and support articles should all live at **company.com**, not scattered across platforms.

## How It Works

Companies connect a subdomain like **docs.company.com** to your platform. Your documentation platform serves pages, search results, and navigation at that custom domain.

Internal links, search functionality, and versioning all work at the custom domain. Your platform powers it invisibly.

## Common Scenarios

- **API documentation** - Technical API reference at company domain
- **Product documentation** - User guides and help articles
- **Developer portals** - Complete developer resources at company domain
- **Knowledge bases** - Support documentation at company domain
- **Open source projects** - Project docs at project domain

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. Then **$0.09/domain/month**. Documentation platforms charge $50-200/month for custom domain support on team and enterprise plans.

## Get Started

Help software companies host professional documentation at their own domain. Custom domains make your platform invisible infrastructure.
