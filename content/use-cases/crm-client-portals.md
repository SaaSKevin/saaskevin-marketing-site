# Custom Domains for CRM & Client Portals

Agencies and consultancies want clients accessing **portal.agency.com**, not **yourcrm.com/agency**.

When an agency charges clients $10k/month, those clients expect professional systems. A client portal at **yourplatform.com/agency123** undermines the agency's premium positioning. Custom domains solve this.

## The Problem

Client-facing portals need to reflect the business's brand, not the software vendor's. When clients log in to view project status, invoices, or reports, they should see **agency.com**, not **yourcrm.com**.

Agencies, consultancies, and service businesses live or die by perceived professionalism. If a $50k project is managed through a portal at someone else's domain, it looks like the agency is using budget tools.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Make client portals feel like custom-built software:

- **Branded client access** - **portal.agency.com** instead of platform branding
- **White-label experience** - Clients never see your platform name
- **Professional emails** - Portal notifications from agency's domain
- **Custom authentication** - Login at agency's domain, not yours

## Why CRM Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Agency Market**: Marketing agencies, dev shops, and consultancies all need white-label client portals. Without custom domains, you can't sell to this market.

**Enterprise Clients**: Large companies using your CRM for customer portals need their company domain. Without it, you're eliminated from enterprise deals.

**Competitive Differentiation**: Most CRMs force platform branding. Custom domains let you position as "white-label by default."

**Higher Pricing**: Agencies and consultancies will pay $200-500/month for CRM with custom domain support. It's a premium feature that justifies premium pricing.

## How It Works

Businesses connect a subdomain like **portal.company.com** to your platform. Clients access projects, documents, and communications at that custom domain.

Your platform handles authentication, data display, and notifications. The business's brand stays consistent throughout the client experience.

## Common Use Cases

- **Marketing agencies** - Client campaign dashboards and reports
- **Development shops** - Project tracking and deliverables
- **Consultancies** - Client communication and documentation
- **Service providers** - Customer account management portals
- **SaaS companies** - Customer success portals at company domain

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. Then **$0.09/domain/month**. CRM platforms charge $50-200/month extra for white-label custom domains.

## Get Started

Give agencies and consultancies the white-label infrastructure they need. Custom domains make your CRM invisible while powering their client relationships.
