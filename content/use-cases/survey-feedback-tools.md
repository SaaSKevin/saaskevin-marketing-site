# Custom Domains for Survey & Feedback Tools

Companies want customer feedback at **feedback.company.com**, not **yoursurvey.com/company**.

SurveyMonkey and Qualtrics both support custom domains because professional research and customer experience teams won't send surveys from someone else's domain. Brand trust matters for response rates.

## The Problem

When a company sends a customer satisfaction survey, the URL needs to be trustworthy. **randomsurveyplatform.com/survey123** looks like phishing. **company.com/feedback** looks legitimate.

Response rates drop 30-50% when surveys come from unfamiliar domains. Customers assume spam or scams when they don't recognize the survey URL.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Make surveys feel like official company communications:

- **Surveys at company domain** - **company.com/survey-name** builds trust
- **Branded survey pages** - Company's domain throughout the experience
- **Custom thank-you pages** - Post-survey experience at their domain
- **Email integration** - Survey invitations reference company's domain

## Why Survey Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Higher Response Rates**: Surveys at recognized domains get 2-3x higher response rates. Customers trust **company.com**, not **unknownsurveysite.com**.

**Enterprise Requirements**: Large companies doing customer research need surveys at their domain for brand guidelines compliance.

**Email Deliverability**: Survey invitation emails with links to the company's domain are less likely to be marked as spam.

**Professional Research**: Market research firms conducting studies for clients need custom domains for each client's brand.

## How It Works

Companies connect a domain or subdomain to your survey platform. When respondents click survey links, they visit **company.com/survey**, not your platform URL.

Survey questions, progress indicators, and submission confirmations all display at the custom domain. Your platform handles response collection and analysis invisibly.

## Common Scenarios

- **Customer satisfaction surveys** - NPS and CSAT at company domain
- **Employee feedback** - Internal surveys at company domain
- **Market research** - Professional research studies with branded surveys
- **Product feedback** - User research at product domain
- **Event feedback** - Post-event surveys at event domain

## Pricing

**First 3 domains free**. Then **$0.15/domain/month**. Survey platforms charge $50-200/month for custom domain support, especially for enterprise plans.

## Get Started

Help companies collect better feedback with higher response rates. Custom domains build trust and increase participation.
