# Custom Domains for Restaurant Reservations

Restaurants want guests booking at **restaurant.com/reservations**, not **yourplatform.com/restaurant**.

OpenTable charges restaurants a fee per reservation. Alternatives are emerging, but most force restaurant branding through their platform domain. Give restaurants their independence—let them take bookings at their own domain.

## The Problem

When a guest searches for a restaurant and clicks through to make a reservation, they expect to land on the restaurant's website, not a third-party booking platform. If the URL changes from **restaurant.com** to **yourplatform.com**, trust drops.

High-end restaurants especially care about branding. A Michelin-starred restaurant doesn't want diners booking at **genericbookingapp.com/fancy-restaurant**. They want seamless integration with their brand.

## The Solution

SaaSKevin makes it trivial for restaurants to accept reservations at their own domain:

- **Branded booking experience** - **restaurant.com/book** powered by your platform
- **Automatic SSL** - Secure reservation forms at their domain
- **Email confirmations** - From restaurant's domain, not yours
- **Seamless guest experience** - Guests never leave the restaurant's brand

## Why Reservation Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Win Independent Restaurants**: Restaurants tired of OpenTable fees want alternatives. But they won't switch if it means losing their brand. Custom domains solve this.

**Higher-End Market**: Fine dining establishments require custom domains. They've invested heavily in their brand and won't dilute it with third-party booking URLs.

**White-Label for Restaurant Groups**: Hospitality groups managing multiple restaurants need custom domains for each location. One group might operate 5-15 restaurants.

**Integration with Websites**: Restaurants already have websites. They want a "Book Now" button that keeps guests on their domain, not redirects to yours.

## How It Works

Restaurants add a subdomain (like **book.restaurant.com**) or integrate booking directly into their main domain. SaaSKevin handles DNS verification and SSL. Your platform reads the incoming domain to identify which restaurant's availability to show.

Guests browse availability, select a time, and complete their reservation—all at the restaurant's domain. Confirmation emails come from **reservations@restaurant.com** (with proper SPF/DKIM setup).

## Common Use Cases

- **Fine dining restaurants** - High-end establishments with brand requirements
- **Restaurant groups** - Multiple locations under one management company
- **Hotel restaurants** - Integrated booking at hotel domain
- **Private dining** - Event spaces within restaurants
- **Food halls** - Multiple vendors with centralized booking

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. Then **$0.09/domain/month**. Restaurant management companies might pay $10-20/month per location for custom domain booking—significantly cheaper than OpenTable's per-cover fees.

## Get Started

Give restaurants the branded reservation experience their guests expect. Custom domains integrate your platform invisibly into their existing brand.
