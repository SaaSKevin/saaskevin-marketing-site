# Custom Domains for Podcast Hosting

Podcasters want their show at **podcastname.com**, not **yourplatform.com/podcast**.

Podcast hosting platforms like Transistor and Captivate support custom domains because professional podcasters need branded websites. If you make custom domains difficult, podcasters will choose a competitor.

## The Problem

When podcasters promote their show, they want to send listeners to **podcastname.com**, not **yourplatform.com/shows/podcast123**. The custom domain makes the show feel professional and established.

Podcasters with sponsors especially need custom domains. Sponsors want to be associated with **podcastname.com**, not some generic hosting platform URL.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Give podcasters the branded presence they need:

- **Show website at custom domain** - **podcast.com** instead of platform URLs
- **Episode pages** - Individual episodes at podcast's domain
- **Embed player** - Audio player that can be embedded anywhere
- **RSS feed** - Podcast RSS at their domain for portability

## Why Podcast Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Professional Positioning**: Podcasts with 10k+ listeners need professional infrastructure. Custom domains signal credibility to sponsors and guests.

**Sponsor Requirements**: Sponsors prefer being associated with **podcastname.com** vs. **hostingplatform.com/podcast**. Custom domains help podcasters land better sponsors.

**SEO and Discovery**: When episodes rank in search, podcasters want their domain benefiting, not yours.

**Network Shows**: Podcast networks managing multiple shows need custom domains for each show. This creates strong lock-in.

## How It Works

Podcasters connect their domain to your platform. Your hosting platform serves show pages, episode pages, and media files at **podcastname.com**.

RSS feeds point to the custom domain. Podcast players and directories reference the custom domain. Everything feels like an independent podcast brand.

## Common Use Cases

- **Independent podcasts** - Solo shows with professional branding
- **Business podcasts** - Company podcasts at company domain
- **Podcast networks** - Multiple shows under network domains
- **Niche topic podcasts** - Topic-specific shows with custom domains
- **Interview shows** - Professional interview shows at custom domains

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. Then **$0.09/domain/month**. Podcast platforms charge $10-20/month for custom domain support.
