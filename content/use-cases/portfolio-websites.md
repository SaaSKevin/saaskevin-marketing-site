# Custom Domains for Portfolio Websites

Professional creatives don't put their portfolio on **yourplatform.com/username**. They need **theirname.com**.

When a designer sends **yourbuilder.com/designer123** to a potential client, they're advertising your platform, not their work. Custom domains flip the script—your platform becomes invisible infrastructure powering their professional brand.

## The Problem

Portfolio platforms are competing with WordPress, Squarespace, and Webflow. These platforms all support custom domains out of the box. If you don't, you're eliminating your platform from consideration for any serious creative professional.

Freelancers, agencies, and established professionals need to present a cohesive brand. Having their portfolio on a subdomain or subdirectory of your platform signals "budget tool" instead of "professional solution."

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Add white-label custom domains to your portfolio builder without rebuilding your infrastructure:

- **Automatic SSL** - Every custom domain gets HTTPS instantly
- **DNS made simple** - Visual guide walks users through connecting their domain
- **Zero backend changes** - Read one header to identify which portfolio to serve
- **Instant verification** - No waiting days for SSL certificates

## Why Portfolio Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Target Professional Market**: Students and hobbyists are fine with subdomains. Professionals who charge $100+/hour need their own domain.

**Reduce Churn**: When a user connects their personal domain to your platform, switching costs go up dramatically. They've made a commitment.

**Premium Pricing**: Custom domain support justifies a professional tier. Charge $10-20/month extra for custom domain users.

**Referral Quality**: When clients visit **designer.com** instead of **yourplatform.com/designer**, they don't even know you exist. That's perfect—you're infrastructure, not a competing brand.

## How It Works

Your users bring a domain they own (or buy one through your partner links). They add a CNAME record. SaaSKevin handles:
- DNS verification
- SSL certificate provisioning
- Automatic renewal
- Routing their domain to your platform

Your application reads `X-SaaSKevin-Customer-Id` to determine which user's portfolio to display. Three lines of code.

## Common Scenarios

- **Freelance designers** - Client-facing portfolio at their personal domain
- **Photographers** - Wedding photography business on company domain
- **Illustrators** - Art portfolio at custom domain for professional clients
- **Agencies** - Team portfolio sites for different brands they manage
- **Architects** - Project showcase at firm domain

## Pricing

**100 free custom domains** to start. Beyond that, **$0.09/domain/month**. You can pass this cost to users, bundle it into your pricing, or eat it as infrastructure—it's pennies per user.

## Get Started

Stop losing professional users to platforms that support custom domains. Add SaaSKevin in 5 minutes and start converting creatives who need **theirname.com**, not **yourplatform.com/username**.
