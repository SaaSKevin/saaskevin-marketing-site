# Custom Domains for Blog Platforms

Writers want to publish at **writer.com**, not **yourplatform.com/writer**.

Medium forces writers onto **medium.com/@writer** URLs. Ghost makes custom domains possible but requires technical setup. Make custom domains trivially easy and win the independent publishing market.

## The Problem

Professional writers and publishers view their blog as a media property. They want to own **writername.com**, not rent a subdirectory on someone else's domain.

When writers build an audience, they're terrified of platform risk. If they publish at **yourplatform.com/writer** for years, then you change pricing or policies, they lose their URL. Custom domains solve this anxiety.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Give writers the independence they crave:

- **Publish at their domain** - **writer.com** instead of platform branding
- **SEO ownership** - Writers build domain authority, not you
- **Email newsletters** - Send from their domain for better deliverability
- **Brand consistency** - Blog, newsletter, and social all reference their domain

## Why Blog Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Compete with Medium**: Medium's biggest weakness is domain lock-in. Offer custom domains easily and win frustrated Medium writers.

**Professional Market**: Writers making $50k+/year need their own domain. Without custom domain support, they'll use WordPress or Ghost.

**SEO Benefits**: Writers want search rankings at their domain. When **writer.com** ranks in Google, they own that traffic. When **platform.com/writer** ranks, you do.

**Newsletter Integration**: Writers sending newsletters from **newsletter@writer.com** get better deliverability than **platform.com** addresses.

## How It Works

Writers connect their domain to your platform. Your blogging platform serves articles, author pages, and archive pages at **writer.com**.

RSS feeds, social meta tags, and sitemap.xml all reference the writer's custom domain. To readers and search engines, it looks like an independent site.

## Common Scenarios

- **Independent journalists** - Professional reporting at personal domain
- **Technical bloggers** - Dev blogs at personal domains
- **Business bloggers** - Thought leadership at company domain
- **Niche publishers** - Topic-specific publications
- **Multi-author publications** - Small media companies at their domain

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. Then **$0.09/domain/month**. Blog platforms charge $5-15/month for custom domain support.

## Get Started

Give writers the publishing platform they deserve—one that respects their need to own their domain and their audience.
