# Custom Domains for Form Builders

Organizations want forms at **forms.company.com**, not **yourplatform.com/company/form**.

When a business collects customer data through forms, the URL matters. **company.com/contact** builds trust. **randomformbuilder.com/form123** raises red flags. Custom domains make forms feel native to the brand.

## The Problem

Typeform, Google Forms, and similar tools force their branding on every form. When users submit sensitive information (email, phone, payment details), they're more likely to complete forms at trusted domains.

Businesses running lead generation, customer feedback, or registration forms need brand consistency. Every form interaction should reinforce their brand, not promote a form builder tool.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Make forms feel like part of the website:

- **Forms at custom domain** - **company.com/form-name** instead of platform URLs
- **Automatic SSL** - Secure data collection at any domain
- **Branded thank-you pages** - Post-submission experience at their domain
- **Email notifications** - Form responses from company's domain

## Why Form Builders Need Custom Domains

**Higher Conversion Rates**: Forms at trusted domains get 20-40% higher completion rates. Users hesitate to submit data to unfamiliar domains.

**Enterprise Sales**: Companies collecting customer data need HIPAA, GDPR, or SOC2 compliance. Custom domains at their infrastructure are often compliance requirements.

**Professional Appearance**: A financial services company can't use **formbuilder.com/financialcorp** for client onboarding. They need **financialcorp.com/onboarding**.

**Embedded Forms**: When forms are embedded on websites, custom domains prevent mixed-content warnings and maintain seamless user experience.

## How It Works

Users connect a domain or subdomain to your form builder. When respondents visit **company.com/form-name**, your platform serves the form at that custom domain.

Form submissions, file uploads, and thank-you pages all happen at the custom domain. Your platform processes everything behind the scenes.

## Common Scenarios

- **Lead generation forms** - Marketing forms at company domain
- **Customer surveys** - Feedback collection with brand consistency
- **Registration forms** - Event registration and sign-ups
- **Application forms** - Job applications, school applications
- **HIPAA-compliant forms** - Healthcare data collection at provider domain

## Pricing

**First 3 domains free**. Then **$0.15/domain/month**. Form builders typically charge $20-50/month for custom domain support.
