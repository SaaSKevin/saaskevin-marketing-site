# Custom Domains for Course Platforms

Course creators want students learning at **course.com**, not **yourplatform.com/course**.

Teachable, Thinkific, and Kajabi all support custom domains because professional course creators won't settle for platform-branded URLs. If students access courses at **yourplatform.com/instructor**, it undermines the instructor's authority.

## The Problem

When an instructor charges $500-2000 for a course, students expect a professional experience. Accessing course content at **yourplatform.com/instructor** makes the course feel like it's hosted on a cheap tool, not an expert's professional system.

Instructors building long-term education businesses need brand consistency. If they have multiple courses, a community, and a blog, they want everything at **instructorname.com**—not scattered across different domains.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Give course creators the branded learning experience they need:

- **Course access at custom domain** - **instructor.com/courses** powered by your platform
- **Student dashboard** - Login and course progress at instructor's domain
- **Certificate URLs** - Completion certificates reference instructor's domain
- **Professional appearance** - Custom domain signals high-quality content

## Why Course Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Premium Pricing Justification**: Instructors charging $1000+ for courses need professional infrastructure. Custom domains are part of that premium experience.

**Instructor Branding**: Course creators are building personal brands. They need course delivery at their domain to maintain authority and credibility.

**Multi-Course Strategy**: Instructors with 3-10 courses need a unified domain hosting all content. This locks them into your platform long-term.

**White-Label for Agencies**: Education agencies creating courses for corporate clients need custom domains for each client's brand.

## How It Works

Course creators connect their domain to your platform. Students access courses, watch videos, complete assignments, and receive certificates—all at the instructor's custom domain.

Your platform handles video hosting, progress tracking, payment processing, and student management. The instructor's brand stays front and center.

## Common Scenarios

- **Expert instructors** - Professional educators with premium courses
- **Corporate training** - Companies hosting internal training at company domain
- **Certification programs** - Professional certification courses with branded delivery
- **Coaching programs** - High-ticket coaching with course components
- **University extensions** - Academic institutions offering online courses

## Pricing

**First 3 domains free**. Then **$0.15/domain/month**. Course platforms typically charge $30-100/month for custom domain access, making this a lucrative feature.

## Get Started

Give course creators the professional platform they need to charge premium prices. Custom domains make your platform invisible while amplifying instructor brands.
