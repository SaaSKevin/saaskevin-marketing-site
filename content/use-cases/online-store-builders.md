# Custom Domains for Online Store Builders

Merchants want to sell at **shop.com**, not **yourplatform.com/shop**.

Shopify made custom domains mandatory because they understood that no serious business will sell products at someone else's domain. If you're building an e-commerce platform, custom domains aren't optional—they're table stakes.

## The Problem

When customers buy from **yourplatform.com/merchantname**, they're not sure who they're buying from. Is it your platform? The merchant? Some marketplace? This confusion kills conversion rates.

Merchants know that **theirshop.com** builds trust. SSL certificates at their domain prove legitimacy. Search engines index their domain, not yours. Payment processors treat custom domains better than subdomains.

Without custom domain support, you can't compete with Shopify, WooCommerce, or any serious e-commerce platform.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Make custom domains trivial for your merchants:

- **Branded storefronts** - **merchant.com** instead of **yourplatform.com/merchant**
- **Automatic SSL** - Every checkout page gets HTTPS instantly
- **Payment processor compatibility** - Stripe, PayPal, etc. all work seamlessly
- **SEO benefits** - Merchants own their search rankings, not you

## Why E-Commerce Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Customer Trust**: Shoppers hesitate to enter credit card details on unfamiliar domains. Custom domains with SSL certificates build immediate trust.

**Payment Processing**: Stripe and PayPal have lower fees and fewer restrictions for custom domains vs. shared platform domains.

**Search Engine Rankings**: Merchants want their products ranking in Google at their domain, not yours. Custom domains make this possible.

**Business Credibility**: A merchant selling $10k/month in revenue needs **theirshop.com**, not **yourplatform.com/theirshop**. Custom domains signal legitimacy.

## How It Works for Your Platform

Merchants connect a domain they own. SaaSKevin handles DNS verification, SSL provisioning, and routing. Your platform reads `X-SaaSKevin-Customer-Id` to identify which store to display.

Product pages, cart, and checkout all happen at the merchant's domain. To customers, it looks like a standalone e-commerce site. Behind the scenes, your platform powers everything.

## Common Scenarios

- **Small business shops** - Local businesses selling online at company domain
- **Direct-to-consumer brands** - Product brands with custom storefronts
- **Dropshipping stores** - Merchants building branded stores
- **Niche marketplaces** - Vertical-specific stores with custom domains
- **Print-on-demand shops** - Custom product sellers with branded domains

## Pricing

**First 3 domains free**. Then **$0.15/domain/month**. E-commerce platforms typically charge $10-30/month for custom domain support, making this a highly profitable feature.

## Get Started

Give merchants the professional storefront they need to compete. Custom domains aren't optional for e-commerce—they're required.
