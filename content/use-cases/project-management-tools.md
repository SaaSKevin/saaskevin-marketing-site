# Custom Domains for Project Management Tools

Agencies want client workspaces at **projects.agency.com**, not **yourplatform.com/agency**.

When an agency manages $100k projects for Fortune 500 clients, those clients can't collaborate in a workspace at **yourpm-tool.com/randomagency**. It looks unprofessional. Custom domains solve this instantly.

## The Problem

Client-facing project management needs to reflect the service provider's brand. When a client logs into a project workspace, they should see the agency's domain—not a generic PM tool URL.

Agencies managing multiple clients need separate branded workspaces. **client1.agency.com** and **client2.agency.com** both pointing to your platform, each with isolated project data.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Make project workspaces feel like custom-built systems:

- **Branded workspaces** - **projects.company.com** instead of platform URLs
- **Per-client subdomains** - **clientname.agency.com** for each client
- **White-label interface** - Clients never see your platform branding
- **Custom notifications** - Project updates from company's domain

## Why Project Management Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Agency Market**: Digital agencies, dev shops, and consultancies all need white-label project management. Custom domains are required to sell to this segment.

**Enterprise Clients**: Companies using your PM tool for external collaboration (with clients, partners, or vendors) need custom domains for brand consistency.

**Multi-Tenant Agencies**: Agencies managing 10-50 clients need per-client workspace domains. Once set up, switching platforms becomes extremely painful.

**Premium Positioning**: Custom domains justify charging agencies $200-500/month vs. the $20/month you charge individual teams.

## How It Works

Agencies or companies connect domains or subdomains to workspaces. Each client or team gets their own branded environment. Your platform routes based on the incoming domain and serves the appropriate project data.

Clients collaborate on tasks, view timelines, and receive notifications—all at the agency's custom domain. Your platform powers it invisibly.

## Common Use Cases

- **Digital agencies** - Client project workspaces at agency domain
- **Development shops** - Client sprints and deliverable tracking
- **Consultancies** - Engagement management with clients
- **Enterprises** - Cross-company collaboration at company domain
- **Freelancer collectives** - Shared project spaces for client work

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. Then **$0.09/domain/month**. PM platforms targeting agencies charge $100-300/month for white-label custom domain support.

## Get Started

Give agencies the white-label project management they need to serve enterprise clients. Custom domains make your platform invisible infrastructure.
