# Custom Domains for Creator Storefronts

Creators selling digital products want **shop.creatorname.com**, not **yourplatform.com/creatorname/shop**.

When a creator directs their audience to buy their course, templates, or digital products, they want that purchase happening on their brand, not yours. Custom domains make your platform invisible while powering their entire business.

## The Problem

Gumroad, Payhip, and Sellfy all support custom domains for the same reason: creators who are serious about their business won't settle for a branded checkout experience from someone else's platform.

When a creator sells a $500 course at **yourplatform.com/creator/checkout**, they're trusting you with their brand reputation. But they also know they don't control that URL. If they ever leave your platform, all their payment links break.

## The Solution

SaaSKevin lets you offer custom storefront domains without the engineering complexity:

- **Branded checkout** - Payment happens at **shop.creator.com**, not your domain
- **Email compatibility** - Creators can send purchase links from their domain
- **Trust signals** - Custom domain + SSL = professional, secure checkout
- **Simple setup** - DNS wizard guides creators through connection

## Why Creator Storefront Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Higher Conversion Rates**: When a customer sees **creator.com/buy** instead of **randomplatform.com/creator**, trust increases. Conversion rates go up 15-30%.

**Enterprise Creators**: The creators making $50k+/year from digital products all want custom domains. If you can't offer it, they'll use a competitor.

**Reduced Platform Risk**: Creators worry about platform dependency. Custom domains give them portability—they can change the backend but keep their links working.

**Premium Feature**: Custom domains justify your professional tier pricing. Bundle it with priority support and advanced analytics.

## How It Works for Your Platform

1. **Embed our widget** in your storefront settings
2. **Creator adds their domain** (or subdomain like shop.creatorname.com)
3. **We handle DNS + SSL** automatically
4. **You read a header** to identify which storefront to display

Your checkout flow doesn't change. Your payment processing stays the same. The only difference is the domain name in the browser.

## Common Scenarios

- **Course creators** - Sell courses at their own domain
- **Template sellers** - Design templates, Notion templates, spreadsheet templates
- **Digital downloads** - eBooks, guides, workbooks at custom domains
- **Membership sites** - Recurring subscriptions at branded domains
- **Software tools** - Creators selling their own mini-SaaS products

## Pricing

First **3 domains are free**. Then **$0.15/domain/month**. Only pay for active domains. If a creator removes their domain or churns, you stop paying.

Most platforms charge creators $10-20/month for custom domain access and pocket the difference.

## Get Started

Give your creators the professional storefront they need. Custom domains boost trust, increase conversions, and reduce platform risk.
