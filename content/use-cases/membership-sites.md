# Custom Domains for Membership Sites

Community builders want members accessing **community.com**, not **yourplatform.com/community**.

Patreon forces creators onto **patreon.com/creator** URLs. Circle and Mighty Networks offer custom domains, but charge premium prices. If you make custom domains easy and affordable, you win the membership site market.

## The Problem

When members pay $20-200/month for exclusive content, they expect a premium experience. Accessing the community at **yourplatform.com/communityname** feels cheap—like the creator couldn't afford proper infrastructure.

Community builders are creating long-term assets. A community of 500 paying members generating $10k/month isn't using **yourplatform.com** forever. They'll eventually want **community.com**. Give them that from day one.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Make custom domain membership sites simple:

- **Community at custom domain** - **community.com** instead of platform branding
- **Member login** - Access gated content at the creator's domain
- **Email notifications** - Member updates from community's domain
- **Brand consistency** - Everything feels like the creator's proprietary platform

## Why Membership Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Premium Community Positioning**: Membership sites charging $50-500/month need professional branding. Custom domains justify premium pricing.

**Creator Ownership**: Community builders worry about platform dependency. Custom domains give them portability (even though they rarely switch once set up).

**Enterprise Communities**: Companies running internal communities or customer communities need custom domains at their company domain.

**Multi-Community Operators**: Creators running 2-5 different communities need custom domains for each. This creates massive lock-in to your platform.

## How It Works

Community creators connect a domain or subdomain to your platform. Members access content, participate in discussions, and receive notifications—all at the custom domain.

Your platform handles authentication, content delivery, payment processing, and community moderation. The creator's brand remains front and center throughout the member experience.

## Common Scenarios

- **Expert communities** - Premium access to expert knowledge
- **Mastermind groups** - High-ticket accountability communities
- **Fan clubs** - Creator fan communities with exclusive content
- **Professional networks** - Industry-specific professional communities
- **Corporate communities** - Internal employee communities or customer communities

## Pricing

**First 3 domains free**. Then **$0.15/domain/month**. Membership platforms charge $50-200/month for custom domain access, making this highly profitable.

## Get Started

Give community builders the professional platform their members deserve. Custom domains make your infrastructure invisible while amplifying creator brands.
