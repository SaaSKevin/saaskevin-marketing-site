# Custom Domains for Newsletter Landing Pages

Newsletter writers want their publication at **newsletter.com**, not **yourplatform.com/newsletter**.

Substack made custom domains hard on purpose—lock-in. But that's exactly why writers are looking for alternatives. If you make custom domains easy, you win the professional newsletter market.

## The Problem

Serious newsletter operators—the ones making $5k-50k/month—view their newsletter as a media brand. They want **theirdomain.com**, not **yourplatform.substack.com** or **yourplatform.com/theirnewsletter**.

When a newsletter grows, the writer starts thinking about switching platforms. If they're on **yourplatform.com/newsletter**, switching means breaking every link they've ever shared. If they're on **newsletter.com** pointing to your platform, switching is just updating DNS.

But here's the secret: once they've set up a custom domain and integrated it into their brand, switching becomes painful. They have to migrate DNS, update SSL, and risk downtime. Most won't bother.

## The Solution with SaaSKevin

Give newsletter writers the custom domain experience they want:

- **Publication at their domain** - theirdomain.com, not a subdomain of yours
- **Automatic SSL** - HTTPS works instantly, no certificate management
- **Email sending domain** - Use their domain for newsletter delivery (better deliverability)
- **Zero infrastructure work** - We handle DNS verification and SSL

## Why Newsletter Platforms Need Custom Domains

**Compete with Substack**: The biggest complaint about Substack is domain lock-in. Make custom domains easy and win over frustrated writers.

**Premium Tier Justification**: Charge $10-30/month extra for custom domain access. Writers making money from their newsletter will gladly pay.

**Better Email Deliverability**: When newsletters send from a custom domain, spam filters treat them better. This alone is worth it for writers.

**Brand Portability (That Rarely Happens)**: Writers think they want portability. In practice, once set up, they rarely switch. But offering it builds trust.

## How It Works

Newsletter writers bring a domain or buy one. They add DNS records following our wizard. Your platform reads `X-SaaSKevin-Customer-Id` to serve the right newsletter.

For email sending, the writer verifies domain ownership with SPF/DKIM records. SaaSKevin guides them through the entire process with copy-paste instructions.

## Common Scenarios

- **Independent journalists** - Professional newsletter at their personal domain
- **Industry experts** - B2B newsletter at company domain
- **Content creators** - Newsletter as part of broader personal brand
- **Communities** - Group newsletters at community domain
- **Media startups** - Small publications that look like real media companies

## Pricing

**First 100 domains free**. Then **$0.09 per domain per month**. Most newsletter platforms charge writers $10-20/month for custom domain support, making this a profitable feature.

## Get Started

Position your platform as the Substack alternative that respects writers' independence. Custom domains are the feature that wins professional newsletter creators.
