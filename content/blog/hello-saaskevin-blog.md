Custom domains are one of those “simple on paper” features that explode into a week of DNS edge cases, SSL headaches, and support tickets.

SaaSKevin exists to make custom domains feel boring again—in the best way:

- **Fast to ship**: a small integration surface area that doesn’t invade your codebase.
- **Reliable**: the kinds of defaults that survive real traffic and real customers.
- **White‑label**: your customers see *your* product, not a third-party setup maze.

## What this blog is for

This blog will stay practical and specific. Expect posts about:

- Product decisions (trade-offs, not platitudes)
- Implementation details (DNS, TLS, routing, onboarding UX)
- Operating a domain feature in production (alerts, support, sharp edges)

If you’re building a SaaS and want custom domains without the pain, you’re in the right place.
